# C_String
---
It is a labwork of [Yuriy Pasichnyk](https://github.com/Fenix-125), [Denys Datsko](https://github.com/ddatsko), [Solomiia Lenio](https://github.com/sol4ik), [Kolya Morgunenko](https://github.com/Myralllka). The task is to write our library for working with strings in C using SSO(Small string optimisation) _(in the process)_. Also, we make a Wrapper on C++ for working with C++ language and compare C++ string library with ours. And we make tests using Google tests _(in the process)_.

## Usage :cyclone:
---
to test our lib, you have to compile it :smile:
so firstly you have to clone it
```
git clone https://github.com/Myralllka/C_String.git && cd C_String
```
then start the script for compiling and making all needed directories
```
bash application.sh
```
then you can either check if library works using out tests to try it on out example "main" program
## main :eyes:
---
Compiled **main** function is now in **bin/** directory.
It takes two positional arguments from the command line: an input file and output file. 
The main example read each word from the text file and sort letters in each word in alphabetic order.
## Requirements
---
We tested this library on the Arch Linux system.
You have to have Linux OS on your pc and installed CMake C/C++ compiler.
